# Module-01 Challange

## User Story

as a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

A webpage meets accessibility standards:

* when I view the source code, I find semantic HTML elements.
* When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* When I view the image elements, I find accessible alt attributes.
* When I view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order.
* When I view the title element, I find a concise, descriptive title.
